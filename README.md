This microservice is run a GCP Cloud Engine VM. The VM is triggered every Thursday by a Pub/Sub event and saves the results in Bigquery Table.
<p>
</p>
In this microservice we will then fit and train a XGBoost model with the pre-developed and self-engineered features from the previous <a href="https://github.com/nichohelmut/bookie_clustering_ms">clustering</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nichohelmut/bookie_xgb_preprocess">preprocessing</a>preprocessing services.
<p>
</p>
‚ÄòXGBoost is an open source library providing a high-performance implementation of gradient boosted decision trees.‚Äô Instead of just building multiple trees at parallel, it builds them sequentially in order to reduce the errors from the previous tree.
<p>
</p>
While creating the XGBoost classifier, as parameter: ‚Äòobjective‚Äô, we will use ‚Äòmulti:softprob‚Äô, where the result will contain predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class. This is helpful since we do not have a binary, but a multi classification problem.
