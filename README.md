In this microservice we will then fit and train a XGBoost model with the pre-developed and self-engineered features from the previous <a href="https://github.com/nichohelmut/bookie_clustering_ms">clustering</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nichohelmut/bookie_xgb_preprocess">preprocessing</a>preprocessing services.

‘XGBoost is an open source library providing a high-performance implementation of gradient boosted decision trees.’ Instead of just building multiple trees at parallel, it builds them sequentially in order to reduce the errors from the previous tree.
<p>
</p>
While creating the XGBoost classifier, as parameter: ‘objective’, we will use ‘multi:softprob’, where the result will contain predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class. This is helpful since we do not have a binary, but a multi classification problem.
